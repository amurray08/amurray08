Hi, I'm Arthur Murray. Prior to this class, I have minimal experience with computer science. At my old school, I worked with HTML and CSS about 1-2 times a week from fifth grade to eights grade. I do not remember all that much from the class, however. I decided to take this class because my uncle works in the computer science industry and claims that this class will equip me with very useful skills.
